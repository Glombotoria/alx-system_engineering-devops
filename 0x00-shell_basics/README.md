Shell basics are fundamental concepts and commands used in the command-line interface (CLI) of an operating system, primarily Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS, as well as Windows when using tools like PowerShell or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Hereâ€™s an overview of key shell basics:

What is a Shell?
Definition: A shell is a user interface that provides access to various services of the operating system. It interprets and executes commands entered by the user.
Types of Shells:
Bash (Bourne Again Shell): The most commonly used shell in Linux systems.
Zsh (Z Shell): An extended Bourne shell with many improvements.
Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell): A user-friendly shell with powerful features.
PowerShell: A task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language.
Basic Shell Commands
Navigating the Filesystem:

pwd (Print Working Directory): Displays the current directory path.
cd (Change Directory): Changes the current directory.
ls (List): Lists files and directories in the current directory.
Common options: ls -l (detailed list), ls -a (includes hidden files).
File Operations:

cp (Copy): Copies files or directories.
Example: cp source.txt destination.txt
mv (Move/Rename): Moves or renames files or directories.
Example: mv oldname.txt newname.txt
rm (Remove): Deletes files or directories.
Example: rm file.txt (use rm -r for directories).
File Viewing and Editing:

cat (Concatenate): Displays the content of a file.
Example: cat file.txt
more and less: View file contents one screen at a time.
nano, vi, vim: Text editors for editing file content directly in the terminal.
Shell Scripting
Script Basics: Shell scripts are files containing a series of commands that can be executed together. Typically, they start with a shebang (#!) to specify the interpreter.
Example: #!/bin/bash for a Bash script.
Variables: Used to store data that can be referenced later.
Example: name="John Doe", accessed with $name.
Control Structures:
Conditionals: if, else, elif for decision making.
